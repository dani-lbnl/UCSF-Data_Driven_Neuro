# UCSF Data Driven Neuroscience with Python
A repository to store course materials for the data-driven neuroscience in python - one-day tutorials with talks and hands-on activities using machine learning and neuroscience data. [[THE EVENT]](http://grinberglab.ucsf.edu/python)

This is currently organized into three main sections.

* An introduction to [Machine Learning](machine_learning/) in python, as well as specifically for fMRI encoding and decoding models.
* A tutorial on [Image Processing](image_processing/) with fMRI. Including topics such as segmentation, preprocessing, and data manipulation.
* A tutorial on [Deep Learning](deep_learning/) using two popular packages in python: [`caffe`](deep_learning/caffe) and [`tensorflow`](deep_learning/tensorflow).
